[Jailbreak the PDF Hackathon](http://scholrev.org/hackathon/)

The aim of this project is to extract the data from scholary PDFs using [CERMINE](https://github.com/CeON/CERMINE) and convert the result into [RDF](http://www.w3.org/RDF/).  
In a next step, the references from the PDF should be linked using their [DOI](http://www.doi.org/) using the service at [crossref.org](http://www.crossref.org).

Contributions to this project are welcome, just fork and send me a pull request.
